## Berin's sketches
Hi, I'm [Bernardo Fontes](https://berinfontes.com/), also know as Berin.

This repo contains sketches that I'm creating while learning and exploring [Processing](https://processing.org/).

A compilation with all sketches can be found [here](https://berinhard.github.io/sketches/).

Please, free to [contact me](mailto:bernardoxhc@gmail.com) regarding licenses to use my work, teaching opportunities, consulting or other projects.

Eventually you'll find some `from berin import something` statements. This is my personal "toolbox" with auxiliar functions to save me time and objects to define some structures such as grids. If you want to take a look in the code, you can find it [in this repo](https://github.com/berinhard/berin/).
